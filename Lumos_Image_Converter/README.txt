# Lumos AI Image to Binary Converter

This project utilizes the trained models from the "Lumos AI" project to convert color images to binary images. It requires accuracy and loss models from the grayscale and binary models to function.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. The code assumes unique file locations.


### Prerequisites

Before using this image to binary converter, ensure you have the following:

- Python is already installed (as it's a requirement of the "Lumos AI" project).
- The trained grayscale and binary models from the "Lumos AI" project.
- Images you want to convert to binary.
- Unique file locations to store the converted images.


### Installation

Before using this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or call reticulate::install+python() from reticulate.
