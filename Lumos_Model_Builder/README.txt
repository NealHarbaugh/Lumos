# Lumos AI

This project aims to create two AI models capable of converting images from color to grayscale and from grayscale to color. The unique aspect of this project is its focus on training these models without requiring extensive pre-processed image datasets.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. The code assumes unique file locations.


### Prerequisites

Processed training images will be needed to train the AI models. The code can run on as few images as the specified batch size, but the more unique images provided, the better the models will be.


### Installation

Before using this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or call reticulate::install+python() from reticulate.
