# Lumos AI Grayscale Checkpoint Loader

This project serves as a checkpoint loader for the "Lumos AI" project, allowing you to recover training progress if the code crashes during model training or to continue training at a later date.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. The code assumes unique file locations.


### Prerequisites

Before using this checkpoint loader, ensure you have the following:

- Python is already installed (as it's a requirement of the "Lumos AI" project).
- The previously trained model checkpoint files from the "Lumos AI" project.
